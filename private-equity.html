            <h1>Private Equity</h1>
            <p>Private equity refers to investments made directly into private companies or through buyouts of public companies, resulting in their delisting from stock exchanges.      
These investments are typically managed by private equity firms that aim to improve the company's value over time before exiting through a sale or IPO.
